# Voron Kit Comparison

It's not easy to find information for different kits simultaneously on the internet, which is why I created this repository.

If you happen to know anything about these kits, please let me know by opening an issue or submitting a pull request, and I will add it to the repo.

Currently, there is only information available for the 2.4 kit. If you are interested in contributing information for V0 and Trident kits, you can submit a pull request.
